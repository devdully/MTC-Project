Things this application should accomplish
1. take in clients street address and return thier coords(lat, lon)
2. search nearby locations by variable radius and variable search terms. for now r=10 miles and search term = dentist
3. return the (name, location, phone number, email, specilty) results for the locations into sheets
4. format data into front-end if time allows (open to design)
